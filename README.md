Welcome to the Airbnb Dataset Analysis project! This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`Airbnb.ipynb`) that explores an Airbnb listings dataset, providing insights into pricing, availability, and more. Whether you're a data enthusiast or just curious about Airbnb trends, this project offers a straightforward way to dive into data analysis with Python.

## Overview
This project analyzes an Airbnb dataset to uncover patterns in listings, such as availability across different neighbourhood groups. Using Python libraries like `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib`, the notebook includes initial data exploration and a violin plot visualization to show how availability varies by neighbourhood group. It's a great starting point for understanding Airbnb data trends in a user-friendly way.

## Dataset Description
The dataset (`datasets.csv`) contains information about Airbnb listings with the following key columns:
- **id**: Unique listing identifier
- **name**: Listing title
- **host_id**, **host_name**: Host details
- **neighbourhood_group**, **neighbourhood**: Location details
- **latitude**, **longitude**: Geographic coordinates
- **room_type**: Type of listing (e.g., Entire home/apt, Private room)
- **price**: Price per night (in USD)
- **minimum_nights**: Minimum stay requirement
- **number_of_reviews**, **reviews_per_month**: Review metrics
- **availability_365**: Number of days available per year
- **rating**, **bedrooms**, **beds**, **baths**: Additional listing details

The dataset has 20,770 rows and 22 columns, with some missing values in columns like `price` and `neighbourhood`.

## Prerequisites
To run the notebook, you'll need the following:
- **Python 3.12** or later
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**
- **Required Libraries**:
  ```bash
  pandas
  matplotlib
  seaborn
  numpy
  ```
  Install them using:
  ```bash
  pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
  ```

## How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-folder>
   ```
2. **Place the Dataset**:
   - Ensure `datasets.csv` is in the same directory as `Airbnb.ipynb` or update the file path in the notebook.
3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Airbnb.ipynb
   ```
4. **Run the Cells**:
   - Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to load the dataset, explore it, and generate the visualization.
5. **View the Output**:
   - The notebook includes a violin plot showing the distribution of `availability_365` by `neighbourhood_group`.

## Visualizations
The notebook currently features one visualization:
- **Violin Plot of Availability by Neighbourhood Group**:
  - This plot shows the distribution of listing availability (days per year) across neighbourhood groups (e.g., Brooklyn, Manhattan).
  - Created using `seaborn.violinplot`, it highlights the spread and density of availability, making it easy to compare across locations.
  - Example output: A clean, colorful plot with rotated labels for readability.

To add more visualizations or modify the existing one, you can extend the notebook with additional `seaborn` or `matplotlib` plots.

## Contributing
We'd love to see your ideas! To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Make your changes (e.g., add new visualizations or data cleaning steps).
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Added new feature"`).
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
6. Open a pull request.

Please ensure your code is well-documented and follows the notebook's structure.
